### I'm Tom Reifenberg, a developer and UX designer ðŸ‘‹

After a rewarding career designing landscapes for cities, I adapted my knack for systems-based thinking and problem solving to full stack development; I've found the perfect space between these two markets is the world of UX design.

I enjoy iterating on designs in Figma, digging into new frameworks, and collaborating to make the strongest applications possible. When I'm not honing these skills, I enjoy cooking, camping, and playing videogames.

### Fun Facts:

- ðŸ”­ These days, I'm working on building web apps with Angular and Springboot, while building up prototypes and wireframes in Figma.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing more heavily on skills within UX design, like research, user interviews, and information architecture.
- :handshake: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with environmental data, quicker connections between front/back ends, or interesting hackathons
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about plants (I was previously a landscape architect!), the best hiking around The Great Lakes or Colorado, or anything to do with Typescript
- âš¡  Hobbies: Some of my favorite activities revolve around being outdoors; hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and biking are so much fun, especially with all the options surrounding me in Colorado. Otherwise, playing videogames, reading, and cooking keep me happy in the great indoors.
