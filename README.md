### I'm Tom Reifenberg, a full stack developer 👋

After completing a rigorous dev bootcamp I've joined Cognizant as a full stack developer intern, which has been so thrilling! Outside of heavily focusing on designing apps with Angular and Springboot, I've been broadening my knowledge in the world of infosec.

### Fun Facts:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building apps with Angular and Springboot

- 📫 How to reach me: [My Email](tomreifenberg@protonmail.com)
- ⚡  Hobbies: Some of my favorite activities revolve around being outdoors; hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and biking are so much fun, especially with all the options nearby in Michigan and Wisconsin. Otherwise, playing videogames, learning to play a synthesizer, reading, and cooking keep me happy in the great indoors.
