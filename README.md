### I'm Tom Reifenberg, a software engineer in training wtih MicroTrain Technologies 👋

This training program revolves around the skills needed to become a full stack web developer, which I've enjoyed immensely. Outside of learning about designing better websites and building the databases to make them tick, I've been broadening my knowledge in the world of infosec.
