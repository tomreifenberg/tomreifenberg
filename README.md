### I'm Tom Reifenberg, a full stack developer 👋

After a rewarding career designing landscapes for cities, I adapted my knack for systems-based thinking and problem solving to full stack development.

I enjoy digging into new frameworks, building code with security in mind, and collaborating to make the strongest applications possible. When I'm not honing these skills, I enjoy cooking, camping, and playing videogames.

### Fun Facts:

- 🔭 These days, I'm working on building web apps with Angular and Springboot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can for full stack web development, hybrid mobile apps, and the almighty cloud
- :handshake: I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with environmental data, quicker connections between front/back ends, or interesting hackathons
- 💬 Ask me about plants (I was previously a landscape architect!), the best camping around The Great Lakes, or anything to do with Angular 
- ⚡  Hobbies: Some of my favorite activities revolve around being outdoors; hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and biking are so much fun, especially with all the options nearby in Michigan and Wisconsin. Otherwise, playing videogames, learning to play a synthesizer, reading, and cooking keep me happy in the great indoors.
