### Fun Facts:

- ðŸ”­ These days, I'm desiging some wildly intricate features for a health tech startup.
- :handshake: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with environmental data, quicker connections between front/back ends, or interesting hackathons
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about plants (I was previously a landscape architect!), the best hiking around The Great Lakes or Colorado, or anything to do with design systems.
- âš¡  Hobbies: Some of my favorite activities revolve around being outdoors; hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and biking are so much fun, especially with all the options surrounding me in Colorado. Otherwise, playing videogames, reading, and cooking keep me happy in the great indoors.
